# Pterosphera V2 - Go Variant
> **Currently ON HOLD as I'm getting better traction with OpenSCAD at the moment.**
> 
> An attempt to build out the Pterosphera V2's case using Golang.

## Building
`make run`

## Watching
For quick iterations on Mac, install `fswatch` (via homebrew), then:

```make watch```

This will rebuild every time a Go file changes.  Open finder in gallery mode to the STL to watch it change as you make your edits.
