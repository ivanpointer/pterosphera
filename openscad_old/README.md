# Pterosphera V2

## Trackball Socket

### Printing Notes
When printing stand-alone:

  * Print with the socket opening face-down - the sensor mount will be upward/on the top.  Use a brim, and use tree supports.

## Switch Sockets
These are designed for MX style switches, with:

  * Cutouts for opening the switch in-board, so we can solder in place, and take off the top part of the switch.  This likely won't be used, ever, but it doesn't hurt to have.
  * Notches in (under) the top plate so that the clips on the switches will grab the plate, making it so that they are more secure, and require a tool to remove.
  * Screw hole sockets (for heat-insert), for the Amoeba 1u PCB (Amoeba-royale v2.0 - https://github.com/JKing-B16/keyboard-pcbs/tree/master/amoeba-royale)

### Printing Notes
When printing stand-alone:

  * Print with the top-plate down on the glass bed, with a brim.  Use tree supports.
